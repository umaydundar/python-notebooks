# python-jupyter-notebooks
* This repository contains notebooks for cryptography, machine learning, and high-level computer vision.
* To run all of the notebooks, a conda environment is needed.
* To run some of the computer vision notebooks, PyTorch and scikit-learn libraries are needed.
* Especially for machine learning and computer vision notebooks, for getting better training and testing times, a device with a GPU is suggested, but all notebooks are runnable on CPUs also.
* For some notebooks, you may need to download the train-test dataset in your local environment. Otherwise, some parts may not work. These notebooks contain the necessary information about how to download it on your local machine.
